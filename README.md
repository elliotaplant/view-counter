# View Counter
A super simple, non intrusive page counter

## Getting started
1. Have node
1. Clone the repo
1. `node index.js`

## Counting pages
Make any request to the port the server is running on and it should add it to the count.
For pages you want to track, add this HTML snippet:
```html
<script src="<url of view tracker>" />
```
